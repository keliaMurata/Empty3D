#Noise Terrain Generator
This program uses perlin noise to generate a random terrain by manipulating the z point at different vertices of a mesh and colors the map according to elevation. 
This program is meant to simulate a self updating terrain map, coloring lower elevations in blue to simulate water, and moving eventually into white for snow top mountains.
